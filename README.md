# Vehicle Interaction Analysis ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

Welcome to the Vehicle Interaction Analysis project! This MATLAB-based endeavor explores the dynamic world of vehicular interactions, simulating potential fields to analyze driving scenarios and behaviors.

## Overview

This project is designed to:
- Simulate vehicle interactions in a potential field environment.
- Calculate repulsive forces based on vehicle positions, velocities, and road conditions.
- Visualize and understand potential risks and behaviors in various driving scenarios.

## Project Structure

- **`calculateK2.m`**: MATLAB function for computing the repulsive potential between two vehicles.

    **Inputs:**
    - `x0, y0`: Reference point (object car center mass).
    - `velocity`: Velocity parameter.
    - `tau`: Safety distance threshold.
    - `alpha`: Acceleration of the object.
    - `beta`: Constant coefficient.
    - `M`: Car in motion mass.
    - `x_v2, y_v2`: Coordinates of the other car.
    - `DB`: Driving behavior (drunk driving, speeding, etc.).

    **Outputs:**
    - `vehiclepul`: Calculated repulsive potential.

- **`vehicle_mass_in_motion.m`**: MATLAB function to determine the mass of a vehicle in motion.

    **Inputs:**
    - `mass`: Mass of the vehicle.
    - `velocity`: Velocity parameter.
    - `K_lambda`: Constant coefficient.

    **Outputs:**
    - `M`: Calculated mass of the vehicle in motion.

- **`simulatePotentialField.m`**: MATLAB script to visualize the potential field and analyze vehicle interactions.
